# WhatColour
## What colour are you?
Our personalities can be divided into colours. Each colour has particular traits, and it is important for you to understand these traits. Not only will it help you to psychologically understand the person better, but it will aid how you interact with them. If you know how to get the best out of a person, you will see great results, and better still if you recognise what colour YOU are, you are able to advise people how to get the best out of you, your likes and dislikes, your strengths and your weaknesses.
