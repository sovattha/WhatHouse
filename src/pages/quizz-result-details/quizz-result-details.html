      Don't waffle - remember, they are less patient and whatever you do, don't be vague or ramble on. They value time, so again don't waste their time, don't get too personal as REDS just like to stick to business, don't stray from purpose, these personality types are focused in their thinking, and don't ask irrelevant questions, they get impatient and it does not fit in with their rational thinking patterns. Lastly don't try to take control, REDS are natural leaders and like to feel they are in control.

    <p>
      Be friendly and show genuine interest in them, chat before going into business. It is important to develop trust first, be informal and non-threatening. However, be alert for non-verbal signs of concern, remember they say yes but mean no, but their body language will alay this. If you notice any non-verbal signs of concern, uncover their needs with open questions. Allow them to weigh things up for themselves.
